# CarProjðŸš—
A Multi-Step Form App using **Django** and **Django REST Framework**.

## Features
- A simple web application containing _Customer_, _Car_, and _Address_ Models.
- Created a _Django view_ that gets all the required information to generate a _multi-step form_.
- First takes the Customer information and then takes Car information.
- Added validation on the _UI_ side using **jQuery**.
- Used Django _forms_ to _render_ this multistep form.
- Created **APIs** to save information to the _DB_ after validating it in the Backend.
